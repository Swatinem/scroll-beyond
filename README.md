# scroll-beyond

This is a small plugin for gedit that makes it possible to scroll past the
end of the document so you can have the last lines of a document in the middle
of the scrolling canvas instead of always on the bottom.

**note**: This does *not* actually add lines to the doc, so you canâ€™t just place
the cursor somewhere beyond the end and expect to just type there.

## installation

Copy the `.plugin` and `.py` file to `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/`.
